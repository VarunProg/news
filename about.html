          Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics,
          education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and
          entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events.
          Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes,
          public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient
          times. Technological and social developments, often driven by
          government communication and espionage networks, have increased the
          speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content.
